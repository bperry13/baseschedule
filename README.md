# baseschedule
ASU SER334 Module 2

Compile and run the program using gcc main.c -o main

Tested in C99

If there is a "schedule.txt" file the schedule will automatically load into a new linked list

To enter a new course into the schedule use the prompt. If you're out of the scope of the parameters it should catch it and not let you add the course.

Do not use a custom "schedule.txt" file. "schedule.txt" must be saved by exiting the program so it will properly reload.

Thanks,

Brett Perry
